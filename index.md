## Scope & Call for Papers

Today’s data-centric distributed systems are evolving into large-scale, highly dynamic swarms of autonomous devices and services that span the IoT–edge–cloud continuum. From resource-constrained sensors with intermittent connectivity to powerful, stable data centers, these hybrid environments pose new challenges for dependability, correctness, security, privacy, and real-time operation—especially in safety-critical and industrial domains. Swarm applications must therefore support decentralized coordination and dynamic orchestration, tolerate and recover from faults, self-heal, predict and detect failures, and adaptively manage resources, all while enabling distributed data storage, processing, and AI/ML acceleration.
Our workshop will bring together researchers and practitioners to tackle these challenges head-on. We invite contributions on both practical and theoretical approaches for designing, implementing, verifying, and operating dependable, secure, and decentralized systems in modern computing ecosystems.
By co-locating with SRDS 2025, we underscore our shared commitment to advancing dependability, correctness, and security in swarm-based distributed systems. This workshop is organized in the context of the Horizon Europe Swarm projects P2CODE, TaRDIS, and OASEES.

### Topics of interest
The SwarmAware workshop will convene interdisciplinary communities to address foundational and practical challenges in building such systems. Topics include, but are not limited to:
* Decentralized coordination and consensus mechanisms
* Fault tolerance, recovery, and self-healing in swarm systems
* Real-time guarantees and resource management at the edge
* Federated, privacy-preserving, and explainable AI for swarms
* Swarm-based decision support and context-aware orchestration
* Secure and resilient distributed computing for cyber-physical systems
* Verification and formal methods for dependable swarms
* Interoperability and semantics in heterogeneous swarm environments
* Human-in-the-loop and neurosymbolic models for swarm control
* AI adaptability in telecom, 5G/6G, and large-scale network infrastructures
* Edge-AI Optical Circuits for Decentralized Broadband Access Networks
* Edge-AI applications in healthcare and bioengineering (e.g., diagnostics, monitoring, personalized care)
* Edge AI models in medical robotics and biosensor coordination 
* Data engineering architectures and pipelines for decentralized learning and analytics
* Workflow orchestration and compliance in health-critical data processing systems
* Scalable swarm intelligence frameworks for smart cities, mobility, and industrial automation
* Trustworthy swarm-based monitoring and resource coordination across heterogeneous infrastructures
* Swarm-enabled decision support systems for high-stakes AI applications in domains such as algorithmic hiring, digital voting, and risk-based rankings
